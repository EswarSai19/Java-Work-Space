	lion, elephant.
	here cat IS-A animal & HAS-A little claws
		 dog IS-A animal & HAS-A medium claws
		 tiger IS-A animal & HAS-A big claws

	All these are having is a relation ship so it is like inheritance and the properties which are
	present in dog,tiger,lion,elephant,cat contains animal properties.
