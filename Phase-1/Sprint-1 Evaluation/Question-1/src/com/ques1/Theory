==> Why String is immutable?

	String is immutable in java because if it is not immutable then lets say for example
	we created string and using the same string in multiple classes. if any changes need to made
	then that string should get updated as well as in all other classes also. Thus it will create 
	problem thats why string is immutable.

==> Difference between String and String Builder?
	
	If we need to use string and at some point the updation of string required to create separate
	variable and then we are able to use it. Here the amount of declaration of variables is limitation 
	while we are using strings.
	
	if we are assigning using string Builder we just need to declaration only once and use it 
	to n number of times by simply appending the new string to the old one.
